WWOOF, which stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. Essentially, WWOOF connects farms and people who are willing to work a set number of hours in exchange for room and board. You can WWOOF almost anywhere on earth, which is awesome, because WWOOFing makes the cost living anywhere on earth ridiculously cheap.
